        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Coding has fascinated me since 2006 when I started university.
        However, given the perception at time that computer science is a very difficult option,
         I was very terrified to pursue it and studied civil enginering instead.It wasnâ€™t upon completion of my master studies, 7 years later, 
         that I decided to shift career and become a full web developer. 
         In order to achieve this, I took online programming   courses 
         on <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/en/dashboard">OPENCLASSROOMS EDUCATION PLATFORM </a> thanks to
          <a href="https://andela.com/alc/"> ANDELA LEARNING COMMUNITY </a>in Rwanda which offered me a generous scholarship.</p> 
          
        <p> Having gained the skills I was longing for, I hope to immerse myself into coding and become an expert in the field. 
          This way, I will make significant contribution to achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) 
          by using the power of technology to create innovative solutions to pressing challenges in Africa.</p>
         
        <p>Here are some SKILLS I've got with so far: </p>
